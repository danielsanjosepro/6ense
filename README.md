## Main Structure:

## Branching:
- `main`: main code for the product. Never push on it.
- `develop`: development branch with changes coming.
- `feature branches` : short living branches to implement new features. Merge them on `develop` with --no-ff to prevent fast forwarting if you are sure that the code works.
